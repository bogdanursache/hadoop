# Hadoop Study Guide

All commands/notes I've taken while practicing Hadoop on the [Cloudera Quickstart VM](http://bit.ly/1R4Gxp6) for the [Hadoop CCA-175 exam](http://www.cloudera.com/training/certification/cca-spark.html). 

###Books: 

The Hadoop ecosystem changes really quickly. As of early 2016, a lot of even the second editions from 2014 or so are already out of date. 

+ Hadoop in Practice (Second Edition) - Manning
+ Learning Spark (First Edition) - OReilly
+ Programming Hive (Second Edition) - OReilly
+ Hadoop: The Definitive Guide (Fourth Edition) - OReilly


### Tutorials Online: 

+ [Michael Noll's](http://www.michael-noll.com/blog/2013/03/17/reading-and-writing-avro-files-from-the-command-line/) are excellent.
